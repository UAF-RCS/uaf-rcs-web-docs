## Content Management Systems

### **Drupal**

Drupal is a popular open source content management system \(CMS\). The Drupal community provides thousands of themes and plugins to customize the appearance and functionality of websites. Its modular architecture makes Drupal an ideal choice for rapid development of virtually any type of website. Examples of the many things that can be built with Drupal include:

* Websites with complex access roles and editing privileges.
* Conference websites with attendee abstract submission and review systems.
* Audio/video content catalogs that are simultaneously served out as podcasts.
* User-friendly databases with intricate tagging and searching systems to aid discovery.
* API endpoints that integrate with other web applications or mobile apps.

For more information, see [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/). RCS provides full support for Drupal hosting, including consultation and development services.

### **WordPress**

WordPress is another popular CMS that is geared towards blogging. Like Drupal, the WordPress community provides thousands of themes and plugins to customize the appearance and functionality of your website. WordPress is best suited for:

* Small-to-medium sized websites.
* Websites with frequent blog entries and simple, static web pages.
* Ease of use at the expense of flexibility.

For more information, see [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/). RCS provides limited support for WordPress hosting.

### Policies and Limitations

**Limited to Research Projects & Groups**

RCS web hosting services are for research projects and groups. Colleges, administrative offices, and academic departments should contact OIT at helpdesk@alaska.edu.

**Security Updates**

Security updates are performed automatically on RCS web hosts to prevent attacks and unauthorized access. In rare cases these updates may introduce compatibility issues that will need to be resolved. RCS is not responsible for fixing issues that arise from automated security updates, but PIs may open a Work Authorization to support consultation and development as needed.

**Expiration**

Each website hosted at RCS expires at the end of each fiscal year unless renewed by the PI. PIs may coordinate with RCS to identify available archive options if a site has reached end-of-life.

**Custom Domains**

Custom domains \(domains not ending in uaf.edu or alaska.edu\) can be purchased at additional cost. These domains must be managed by RCS. New domains will need to be purchased by RCS on the PI's behalf. Existing custom domains will need to be transferred to RCS.
